How to ZOOM

First have a file called articleData.txt, a database file with a row for each article. Each row has the following variables:
aritleID,title, subtitle, imageID, iconID, contentID, etc.



On the page that displays the article:

Make an array of articleIDs from articleData.txt and for each row, then echo a div for that row. The div should contain a linked line of text like so:

<a href="zoom.php?id='.$articleID.'">Click Here to View Article</a>



On the page that is the template for each article (aka zoom.php):

There should be a php tag that starts by defining which row in articleData.txt we are displaying.

<?php

   $currentArticleID = filter_input(INPUT_GET,'id',FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);


   // now  use the $currentArticleID variable to get the rest of the variables form the articleData.txt file.

?>
